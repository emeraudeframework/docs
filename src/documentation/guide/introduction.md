# Introduction

Before deep-diving into the tech stuff let's provide you a little of context of all. **Emeraude** 
(which comes from Middle English, nowadays more popular as emerald) is one of the most popular 
gemstones. It symbolizes love, beauty, **growth**, creativity, focus, and intensity.

Our main intention and desire are to provide you the reality that your product represents the same as the 
emerald and many more. We want to rise your application to a new level in a simple manner, exactly like 
jewels make the difference with the people - just a single and minor piece but at the same time - a huge 
difference.

## What is Emeraude?

Emeraude is a web application framework based on ASP.NET which is delivered in the form of NuGet packages 
that anyone can import into the project that working on. The framework can be considered as separated and 
relatively independent because its main goal is to provide additional features by minor impact over the 
application.
For a more clear view of the framework let's describe what Emeraude is/does and what Emeraude is/does not:

- Emeraude is based on ASP.NET
- Emeraude is written on .NET 6 and C# 10
- Emeraude is a framework - not a library
- Emeraude is a wrapper for an ASP.NET-based web application
- Emeraude can be used for all type web projects - MVC, Web API, RazorPages, Blazor, etc.
- Emeraude provides abstractions, services and utilities out of the box
- Emeraude is configurable
- Emeraude is free and open-source
- Emeraude does not require any licenses and keys to work
- Emeraude does not have any requirements for your application code
- Emeraude does not wrap any UI-related elements (HTML, CSS, JS) into its NuGet packages
- Emeraude is not a CMS, CRM, etc.
- Emeraude is not SaaS, PaaS, etc.
