# Overview

As a significantly innovative product Emeraude exposes a distributed front-end in order to provide better experience
and faster development at the same time. Emeraude Portal is a web client instance that is designed to fit the API
specifications of the framework. The target goal of the portal is to provide a separate and independent place for managing
data that comes from each application that is designed with Emeraude Framework.

To access Emeraude Portal you have to visit **[emeraude.io](https://emeraude.io)**.

::: tip MORE INFORMATION
Emeraude Portal can be considered as a separated product. It is designed to fit the needs of Emeraude Framework, but
at the same time can be used from any other API not related to the current framework. So details about its structure, 
pros and cons can be found on its [website](https://emeraude.io).
