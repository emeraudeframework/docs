The core purpose of Emeraude is to allow that control of all data that flows through the application.

That has been taken into account during Emeraude development so that\'s why the framework provides a runtime engine that is using the context of your application in order to generate client-specific code and a command-line interface for backend purposes.'

Your application could be in conflict or highly coupled with the predefined structures and procedures of the framework. Emeraude extrudes your application by exposing features in a different direction than your application so it becomes not functionally dependent on the framework.'
